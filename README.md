> 🧠 **Abstract:**
> Diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art video generation quality, but their inference remains expensive due to the large number of sequential denoising steps. This has motivated a growing line of
> research on accelerating diffusion inference. Among training-free acceleration methods, caching reduces computation by reusing previously computed model outputs across timesteps. Existing caching methods
> rely on heuristic criteria to choose cache/reuse timesteps and require extensive tuning. We address this limitation with a principled sensitivity-aware caching framework. Specifically, we formalize the
> caching error through an analysis of the model output sensitivity to perturbations in the denoising inputs, i.e., the noisy latent and the timestep, and show that this sensitivity is a key predictor of
> caching error. Based on this analysis, we propose Sensitivity-Aware Caching **SenCache**, a dynamic caching policy that adaptively selects caching timesteps on a per-sample basis. Our framework provides a
> theoretical basis for adaptive caching, explains why prior empirical heuristics can be partially effective, and extends them to a dynamic, sample-specific approach. Experiments on Wan 2.1, CogVideoX,
> and LTX-Video show that SenCache achieves better visual quality than existing caching methods under similar computational budgets.
